The shark invests in the company whose owner is the butterfly. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the gorilla, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the cobra's name, then we can conclude that it captures the king of the mannikin. Rule2: If the dove does not manage to persuade the gorilla, then the gorilla does not capture the king of the mannikin. Rule3: The gorilla stops the victory of the bulldog whenever at least one animal invests in the company owned by the butterfly. Rule4: If the gorilla is watching a movie that was released before covid started, then the gorilla does not stop the victory of the bulldog. Rule5: If something stops the victory of the bulldog and captures the king of the mannikin, then it manages to persuade the cougar. Rule6: If the bee takes over the emperor of the gorilla, then the gorilla is not going to manage to convince the cougar. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule5.",
