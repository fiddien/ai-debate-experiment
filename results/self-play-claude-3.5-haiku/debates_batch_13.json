The butterfly does not surrender to the mermaid. The stork does not tear down the castle that belongs to the mermaid. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The dove will call the bison if it (the dove) is watching a movie that was released before Lionel Messi was born. Rule2: If the butterfly does not surrender to the mermaid and the stork does not tear down the castle of the mermaid, then the mermaid falls on a square of the dove. Rule3: Regarding the dove, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"b\", then we can conclude that it calls the bison. Rule4: The living creature that does not swear to the gorilla will never fall on a square of the dove. Rule5: The dove will not call the bison if it (the dove) has a notebook that fits in a 23.5 x 17.3 inches box. Rule6: The dove will not smile at the otter if it (the dove) purchased a time machine. Rule7: If something does not smile at the otter and additionally not call the bison, then it enjoys the companionship of the peafowl. Rule8: One of the rules of the game is that if the mermaid falls on a square that belongs to the dove, then the dove will never enjoy the company of the peafowl. Rule9: Regarding the dove, if it has more money than the mermaid and the dolphin combined, then we can conclude that it does not smile at the otter. Rule1 is preferred over Rule5.
