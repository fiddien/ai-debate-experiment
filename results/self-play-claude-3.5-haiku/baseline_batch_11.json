Relevant Facts:\n- The poodle is currently in Berlin (which is in Germany)\n- The swan invests in the company owned by the poodle\n- The chihuahua is named Teddy\n- The duck is named Tango\n\n2. Rule Analysis:\n- Rule3 states two conditions for the poodle calling the cougar:\n   a) The llama does not take over the emperor of the poodle\n   b) The duck does not create a castle for the poodle\n\n- Rule2 implies that since the basenji swears to the llama, the llama will never take over the emperor of the poodle\n   \u2192 Condition (a) is satisfied\n\n- Rule1 states the duck (Tango) will smile at the poodle if its name starts with the same letter as the chihuahua's name\n   \u2192 Tango does not start with T (Teddy's first letter), so this doesn't apply\n\n- Rule4 states that if the poodle is in Germany (Berlin), it negotiates a deal with the leopard\n   \u2192 This doesn't directly impact the cougar call\n\n- Rule5 states the poodle won't borrow a weapon from the dugong if the swan invests in its company\n   \u2192 This condition is met\n\n3.

Relevant Facts:\n- Dachshund (Bella) has 64 dollars\n- Dachshund has a blue card\n- Coyote has 10 dollars\n- Husky has 49 dollars\n- Dragon is named Blossom\n\n2. Relevant Rules:\n- Rule3: Dachshund enjoys bison if at least one animal dances with the liger\n- Rule6: If stork suspects butterfly, then butterfly dances with liger\n- Rule4 (preferred over Rule7): If dachshund's name starts with same letter as dragon's name, it does not acquire seal photo\n- Rule7: If dachshund has more money than coyote and husky combined, it acquires seal photo\n\n3. Analysis:\n- Dachshund's name (Bella) starts with B\n- Dragon's name is Blossom (also starts with B)\n- Rule4 takes precedence, so dachshund does NOT acquire seal photo\n- We don't know if stork suspects butterfly, so we can't confirm if butterfly dances with liger\n- Without confirmation of liger dance, we cannot prove dachshund enjoys bison's company\n\n4.

Relevant Facts:\n- The dove (Bella) is named Bella\n- The dove currently has 2 friends\n- The dove will turn 5 years old soon\n- The snake is named Lola\n\n2. Analyzing the Rules:\n- Rule1: If dove has >12 friends, it does not suspect the dalmatian\n- Rule2: If dove can carry apples/oranges, it does not suspect the dalmatian\n- Rule3: If dove suspects the dalmatian, the dalmatian falls on a mule's square\n- Rule4: If dove is <2 years old, it suspects the dalmatian\n- Rule5: If dove's name starts with same letter as snake's name, it suspects the dalmatian\n\n3. Resolving Rule Conflicts:\n- Rule4 is preferred over Rule1\n- Rule4 is preferred over Rule2\n- Rule5 is preferred over Rule1\n- Rule5 is preferred over Rule2\n\n4. Checking Conditions:\n- Dove is 5 years old (not <2), so Rule4 does not apply\n- Dove has 2 friends (not >12)\n- Dove's name (Bella) starts with B, snake's name (Lola) starts with L\n- Rule5 applies: dove suspects the dalmatian\n\n5.
