The zebra has a bench, and has twelve friends. The walrus does not hide the cards that she has from the peafowl. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something invests in the company whose owner is the crab and leaves the houses that are occupied by the chihuahua, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also dances with the finch. Rule2: The living creature that swims in the pool next to the house of the monkey will also leave the houses that are occupied by the chihuahua, without a doubt. Rule3: If the zebra has more than eight friends, then the zebra stops the victory of the monkey. Rule4: In order to conclude that the peafowl invests in the company whose owner is the crab, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the walrus does not hide the cards that she has from the peafowl and secondly the vampire does not enjoy the company of the peafowl. Rule5: The zebra will not stop the victory of the monkey if it (the zebra) has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the zebra: if it has a device to connect to the internet then it does not stop the victory of the monkey for sure.

Rule1: Regarding the gorilla, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it stops the victory of the goose. Rule2: If the goose has more than nine friends, then the goose unites with the badger. Rule3: Regarding the goose, if it is watching a movie that was released after the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the badger. Rule4: One of the rules of the game is that if the gorilla negotiates a deal with the goose, then the goose will, without hesitation, suspect the truthfulness of the lizard. Rule5: The gorilla will stop the victory of the goose if it (the gorilla) has more money than the bison.

The key to proving the goose suspects the lizard's truthfulness is Rule4, which states: <quote>if the gorilla negotiates a deal with the goose, then the goose will, without hesitation, suspect the truthfulness of the lizard</quote>\n\n2. I need to determine if a deal between the gorilla and goose has occurred.\n\n3.

The indigo card is not mentioned as a rainbow color, so Rule1 doesn't apply.\n\n5. Rule4 is preferred over Rule6, which means if a deal occurred, the goose would definitely suspect the lizard.\n\n6. The precise definition of \"negotiating a deal\" is not specified, so the interpretation could be broad.\n</thinking>\n\n<argument>\nThe goose must suspect the lizard's truthfulness because Rule4 explicitly states that any deal with the gorilla triggers this suspicion.

Rule2: If something enjoys the company of the dragonfly, then it does not fall on a square that belongs to the shark.

Rule4: For the shark, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the bison does not surrender to the shark and 2) that the reindeer does not tear down the castle that belongs to the shark, then you can add shark builds a power plant close to the green fields of the finch to your conclusions.

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the reindeer, if it has a card whose color appears in the flag of Netherlands, then we can conclude that it falls on a square that belongs to the shark. Rule2: If something enjoys the company of the dragonfly, then it does not fall on a square that belongs to the shark. Rule3: The shark does not build a power plant near the green fields of the finch whenever at least one animal refuses to help the seahorse. Rule4: For the shark, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the bison does not surrender to the shark and 2) that the reindeer does not tear down the castle that belongs to the shark, then you can add shark builds a power plant close to the green fields of the finch to your conclusions. Rule5: There exists an animal which tears down the castle that belongs to the basenji? Then, the bison definitely does not refuse to help the shark.
