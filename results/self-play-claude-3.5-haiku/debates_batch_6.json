The lizard refuses to help the dachshund. The lizard swims in the pool next to the house of the chinchilla. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the finch, if it is in Germany at the moment, then we can conclude that it does not smile at the songbird. Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the finch: if it has a basketball that fits in a 24.9 x 39.5 x 39.5 inches box then it does not smile at the songbird for sure. Rule3: For the songbird, if the belief is that the snake does not negotiate a deal with the songbird and the finch does not smile at the songbird, then you can add \"the songbird builds a power plant near the green fields of the shark\" to your conclusions. Rule4: If something refuses to help the dachshund and swims inside the pool located besides the house of the chinchilla, then it suspects the truthfulness of the crow. Rule5: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, suspects the truthfulness of the crow, then the songbird is not going to build a power plant close to the green fields of the shark.
