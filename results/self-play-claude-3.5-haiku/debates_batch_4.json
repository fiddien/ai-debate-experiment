Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it is watching a movie that was released before Shaquille O'Neal retired then it does not fall on a square that belongs to the camel for sure. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the german shepherd: if it is less than 3 years old then it reveals a secret to the camel for sure.
