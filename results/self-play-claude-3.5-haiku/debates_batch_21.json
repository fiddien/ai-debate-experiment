The dolphin has a computer, and is watching a movie from 1776. The dolphin has a football with a radius of 25 inches. The dolphin supports Chris Ronaldo. The dove has 20 dollars. The wolf has 76 dollars, and is 24 months old. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the dolphin, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the gorilla falls on a square of the dolphin and 2) the wolf does not smile at the dolphin, then you can add that the dolphin will never stop the victory of the mouse to your conclusions. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the german shepherd does not take over the emperor of the dolphin, then the conclusion that the dolphin hugs the dugong follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: Regarding the dolphin, if it has a basketball that fits in a 20.5 x 22.8 x 22.4 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not hug the dugong. Rule4: If the ant pays money to the wolf, then the wolf is not going to invest in the company whose owner is the dolphin. Rule5: If something invests in the company owned by the dinosaur and does not hug the dugong, then it stops the victory of the mouse. Rule6: Regarding the dolphin, if it has a device to connect to the internet, then we can conclude that it invests in the company whose owner is the dinosaur. Rule7: Regarding the dolphin, if it is watching a movie that was released after the French revolution began, then we can conclude that it does not invest in the company owned by the dinosaur. Rule8: Here is an important piece of information about the wolf: if it is less than 12 months old then it invests in the company whose owner is the dolphin for sure.

The dolphin has a computer, and is watching a movie from 1776. The dolphin has a football with a radius of 25 inches. The dolphin supports Chris Ronaldo. The dove has 20 dollars. The wolf has 76 dollars, and is 24 months old. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the dolphin, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the gorilla falls on a square of the dolphin and 2) the wolf does not smile at the dolphin, then you can add that the dolphin will never stop the victory of the mouse to your conclusions. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the german shepherd does not take over the emperor of the dolphin, then the conclusion that the dolphin hugs the dugong follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: Regarding the dolphin, if it has a basketball that fits in a 20.5 x 22.8 x 22.4 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not hug the dugong. Rule4: If the ant pays money to the wolf, then the wolf is not going to invest in the company whose owner is the dolphin. Rule5: If something invests in the company owned by the dinosaur and does not hug the dugong, then it stops the victory of the mouse. Rule6: Regarding the dolphin, if it has a device to connect to the internet, then we can conclude that it invests in the company whose owner is the dinosaur. Rule7: Regarding the dolphin, if it is watching a movie that was released after the French revolution began, then we can conclude that it does not invest in the company owned by the dinosaur. Rule8: Here is an important piece of information about the wolf: if it is less than 12 months old then it invests in the company whose owner is the dolphin for sure. Rule9: Here is an important piece of information about the wolf: if it has more money than the pigeon and the dove combined then it invests in the company whose owner is the dolphin for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule5. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule7. Rule8 is preferred over Rule4. Rule9 is preferred over Rule4.",

The llama has a football with a radius of 28 inches. The owl has 2 dollars. The zebra borrows one of the weapons of the llama. The chihuahua does not bring an oil tank for the llama. The lizard does not neglect the llama. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The llama does not want to see the wolf, in the case where the lizard neglects the llama. Rule2: For the llama, if the belief is that the zebra borrows one of the weapons of the llama and the chihuahua does not bring an oil tank for the llama, then you can add \"the llama tears down the castle of the frog\" to your conclusions. Rule3: This is a basic rule: if the finch falls on a square of the llama, then the conclusion that \"the llama will not bring an oil tank for the dugong\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule4: The llama will want to see the wolf if it (the llama) has more money than the crow and the owl combined. Rule5: Are you certain that one of the animals does not want to see the wolf but it does tear down the castle that belongs to the frog? Then you can also be certain that this animal wants to see the snake. Rule6: Regarding the llama, if it is more than four and a half years old, then we can conclude that it wants to see the wolf. Rule7: The llama will bring an oil tank for the dugong if it (the llama) has a sharp object. Rule8: If the llama has a football that fits in a 54.1 x 55.5 x 62.7 inches box, then the llama brings an oil tank for the dugong. Rule9: Here is an important piece of information about the llama: if it has a device to connect to the internet then it does not tear down the castle of the frog for sure. Rule3 is preferred over Rule7. Rule3 is preferred over Rule8. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1. Rule9 is preferred over Rule2.",

Rule1: If the swan has something to sit on, then the swan does not pay some $$$ to the mannikin. Rule2: The mannikin does not trade one of its pieces with the rhino whenever at least one animal tears down the castle that belongs to the finch. Rule3: The living creature that negotiates a deal with the woodpecker will also pay money to the mannikin, without a doubt. Rule4: Regarding the swan, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"i\", then we can conclude that it does not pay money to the mannikin. Rule5: The living creature that does not disarm the wolf will smile at the mannikin with no doubts. Rule6: For the mannikin, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the swan pays some $$$ to the mannikin and 2) the dragonfly smiles at the mannikin, then you can add \"mannikin trades one of its pieces with the rhino\" to your conclusions.

The swan has a card that is violet in color, and negotiates a deal with the woodpecker. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the swan has something to sit on, then the swan does not pay some $$$ to the mannikin. Rule2: The mannikin does not trade one of its pieces with the rhino whenever at least one animal tears down the castle that belongs to the finch. Rule3: The living creature that negotiates a deal with the woodpecker will also pay money to the mannikin, without a doubt. Rule4: Regarding the swan, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"i\", then we can conclude that it does not pay money to the mannikin. Rule5: The living creature that does not disarm the wolf will smile at the mannikin with no doubts. Rule6: For the mannikin, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the swan pays some $$$ to the mannikin and 2) the dragonfly smiles at the mannikin, then you can add \"mannikin trades one of its pieces with the rhino\" to your conclusions.
