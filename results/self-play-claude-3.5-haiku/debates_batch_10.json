Rule2: There exists an animal which destroys the wall constructed by the coyote? Then the pigeon definitely calls the zebra. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the pigeon: if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the goat's name then it swears to the shark for sure. Rule4: The living creature that swears to the shark will also swear to the seal, without a doubt. Rule5: The living creature that swears to the frog will never call the zebra.
