Relevant Facts:\n- Dragon is named Blossom\n- Dragon is in Ankara\n- Dragon has an 11 x 13 inches notebook\n- Dragon is watching a movie from 1960\n- An owl brings an oil tank for the dugong\n\n2. Analyzing the Rules:\n- Rule1: If an animal does not neglect the bee and invests in the mermaid's company, then it suspects the cougar's truthfulness\n- Rule2: If dragon watches a movie after Nixon's resignation, it does not invest in mermaid's company\n- Rule3: If dragon's notebook fits in 13.9 x 14.3 inches box, it invests in mermaid's company\n- Rule4: Dragon does not neglect the bee if an animal brings an oil tank for the dugong\n- Rule5: If dragon is in South America, it invests in mermaid's company\n\n3. Rule Preferences:\n- Rule3 is preferred over Rule2\n- Rule5 is preferred over Rule2\n\n4. Analyzing Conditions:\n- Movie is from 1960 (before Nixon's resignation)\n- Notebook is 11 x 13 inches (does not fit 13.9 x 14.3 inches box)\n- Dragon is in Ankara (not South America)\n- An oil tank is brought for the dugong\n\n5. Logical Chain:\n- Cannot definitively prove dragon invests in mermaid's company\n- Cannot definitively prove dragon does not neglect the bee\n- Therefore, cannot prove dragon suspects cougar's truthfulness\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: C",

Relevant Facts and Rules:\n- The pigeon does NOT negotiate a deal with the pelikan\n- Rule1: If an animal wants to see the butterfly, then the songbird MUST invest in the company owned by the worm\n- Rule2: If the pigeon does not negotiate with the pelikan, then the pelikan wants to see the butterfly\n\n2. Logical Chain:\n- First, the pigeon does not negotiate with the pelikan\n- By Rule2, this means the pelikan wants to see the butterfly\n- The pelikan wanting to see the butterfly is an animal wanting to see the butterfly\n- Therefore, Rule1 is triggered: the songbird MUST invest in the company owned by the worm\n\n3. Conflict Resolution:\n- There are no conflicting rules\n- The logical chain is complete and leads to a definitive conclusion\n\n4. Proof Chain:\n- Pigeon does not negotiate with pelikan\n- Pelikan wants to see the butterfly\n- An animal wants to see the butterfly\n- Therefore, the songbird invests in the worm's company\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: A",

Relevant Facts:\n- The chinchilla is watching a movie from 1990\n- Rule1: If a living creature suspects the vampire's truthfulness, it will tear down the butterfly's castle\n- Rule2: The chinchilla will suspect the vampire's truthfulness if it's watching a movie released after the Internet was invented\n\n2. Analyzing the Conditions:\n- The Internet was invented in 1969\n- The movie is from 1990, which is AFTER the Internet was invented\n\n3. Logical Chain:\n- The movie is from 1990 (after Internet invention)\n- This means the chinchilla DOES suspect the vampire's truthfulness according to Rule2\n- Since the chinchilla suspects the vampire, Rule1 states it will tear down the butterfly's castle\n\n4. Conclusion:\n- The conditions are met for the chinchilla to tear down the butterfly's castle\n- There are no conflicting rules or preferences\n- The proof chain is complete and straightforward\n\nTherefore, the chinchilla WILL tear down the butterfly's castle.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: A",

Relevant Facts:\n- The badger invests in the company owned by the frog\n- The frog has some kale\n- The leopard unites with the beaver\n\n2. Relevant Rules:\n- Rule1: If an animal unites with the beaver, the worm won't negotiate with the frog\n- Rule2: If an animal takes over the emperor of the dinosaur, the frog won't bring an oil tank for the camel (preferred over Rule3)\n- Rule3: If the badger invests in the frog's company, the frog will bring an oil tank for the camel\n- Rule4: If something doesn't pay money to the camel but brings an oil tank, it invests in the chinchilla's company\n- Rule5: If the frog has kale, it does not pay money to the camel\n\n3. Logical Chain:\n- The badger invests in the frog's company\n- By Rule3, the frog should bring an oil tank for the camel\n- But Rule2 is preferred, which might prevent the oil tank\n- The frog has kale, so by Rule5, it does not pay money to the camel\n- By Rule4, if it brings an oil tank without paying the camel, it must invest in the chinchilla's company\n\nHowever, the conditions for this are ambiguous, so we cannot definitively prove or disprove the statement.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: C",

Relevant Facts:\n- The bulldog is watching a movie from 1907\n- World War 1 started in 1914\n- Rule1: If a movie is from before WWI, the bulldog surrenders to the german shepherd\n- Rule2: If an animal surrenders to the german shepherd, it will unite with the elk\n\n2. Logical Chain:\n- The movie is from 1907, which is before WWI (1914)\n- According to Rule1, this means the bulldog will surrender to the german shepherd\n- Since the bulldog surrenders to the german shepherd, Rule2 states it will also unite with the elk\n\n3. Proof Chain:\n- Movie from 1907 \u279c Before WWI\n- Before WWI \u279c Bulldog surrenders to german shepherd\n- Bulldog surrenders to german shepherd \u279c Bulldog unites with elk\n\nThe logical chain is complete and consistent. Each step follows from the previous one based on the given rules.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: A",
