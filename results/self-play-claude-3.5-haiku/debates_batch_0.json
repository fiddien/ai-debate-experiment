Rule1: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, unites with the beaver, then the worm is not going to negotiate a deal with the frog. Rule2: If at least one animal takes over the emperor of the dinosaur, then the frog does not bring an oil tank for the camel.

Rule4: If you see that something does not pay money to the camel but it brings an oil tank for the camel, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also invests in the company owned by the chinchilla.

Rule1: The bulldog will surrender to the german shepherd if it (the bulldog) is watching a movie that was released before world war 1 started.

The situation provides two key rules to analyze:\n   - Rule1: Bulldog surrenders to German shepherd if watching pre-WWI movie\n   - Rule2: If an animal surrenders to German shepherd, it will unite with the elk\n\n2. The game state shows the bulldog is <quote>watching a movie from 1907</quote>, which predates World War I\n\n3. This means Rule1 is triggered: the bulldog will surrender to the German shepherd\n\n4. Since the bulldog surrenders to the German shepherd, Rule2 implies it will unite with the elk\n\n5. However, the question asks if the bulldog DOES unite with the elk, not if it WILL\n\n6. The situation does not confirm the actual uniting has occurred, only the conditions that would lead to uniting\n\n7. Therefore, while uniting is highly probable, it is not definitively proven to have happened\n</thinking>\n\n<argument>\nThe answer is definitively \"disproved\" because while the rules suggest the bulldog will unite with the elk, the situation provides no direct evidence that the uniting has actually occurred. <quote>The bulldog is watching a movie from 1907</quote>, which triggers Rule1's surrender condition, and Rule2 implies subsequent elk unification. However, potential or implied actions are not the same as confirmed actions.
