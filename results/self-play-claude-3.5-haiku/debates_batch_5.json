Rule2: Are you certain that one of the animals borrows a weapon from the bear and also at the same time swears to the peafowl? Then you can also be certain that the same animal does not bring an oil tank for the mermaid. Rule3: If you are positive that one of the animals does not swim in the pool next to the house of the frog, you can be certain that it will swear to the peafowl without a doubt. Rule4: If the reindeer refuses to help the pelikan, then the pelikan brings an oil tank for the mermaid. Rule5: One of the rules of the game is that if the snake captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the pelikan, then the pelikan will never borrow one of the weapons of the bear.
