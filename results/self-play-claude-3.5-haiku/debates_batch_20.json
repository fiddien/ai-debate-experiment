Rule1: If something does not call the otter, then it dances with the ostrich. Rule2: Regarding the walrus, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the liger's name, then we can conclude that it does not swim in the pool next to the house of the cougar. Rule3: Regarding the walrus, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it calls the otter. Rule4: If something surrenders to the mannikin and calls the fish, then it swims in the pool next to the house of the cougar. Rule5: If the walrus has a football that fits in a 49.8 x 50.7 x 51.3 inches box, then the walrus does not call the otter. Rule6: The walrus will not swim inside the pool located besides the house of the cougar if it (the walrus) has fewer than 8 friends. Rule2 is preferred over Rule4. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5.

Rule2: In order to conclude that the snake does not suspect the truthfulness of the goose, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly that the mouse will not borrow one of the weapons of the snake and secondly the akita shouts at the snake. Rule3: The snake suspects the truthfulness of the goose whenever at least one animal takes over the emperor of the dragonfly. Rule4: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, falls on a square that belongs to the coyote, then the snake acquires a photo of the bear undoubtedly.

Rule1: If the fangtooth does not smile at the frog, then the frog does not acquire a photograph of the bison. Rule2: From observing that one animal acquires a photo of the bison, one can conclude that it also stops the victory of the woodpecker, undoubtedly. Rule3: The frog unquestionably acquires a photo of the bison, in the case where the pelikan does not invest in the company owned by the frog. Rule4: Regarding the frog, if it is watching a movie that was released after covid started, then we can conclude that it refuses to help the swallow. Rule5: The frog will not refuse to help the swallow if it (the frog) is in Turkey at the moment. Rule6: If something refuses to help the swallow and does not capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the walrus, then it will not stop the victory of the woodpecker. Rule7: Regarding the frog, if it has more than 6 friends, then we can conclude that it does not capture the king of the walrus. Rule3 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5.

Rule1: If the fangtooth does not smile at the frog, then the frog does not acquire a photograph of the bison. Rule2: From observing that one animal acquires a photo of the bison, one can conclude that it also stops the victory of the woodpecker, undoubtedly. Rule3: The frog unquestionably acquires a photo of the bison, in the case where the pelikan does not invest in the company owned by the frog. Rule4: Regarding the frog, if it is watching a movie that was released after covid started, then we can conclude that it refuses to help the swallow. Rule5: The frog will not refuse to help the swallow if it (the frog) is in Turkey at the moment. Rule6: If something refuses to help the swallow and does not capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the walrus, then it will not stop the victory of the woodpecker. Rule7: Regarding the frog, if it has more than 6 friends, then we can conclude that it does not capture the king of the walrus. Rule3 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5.

The frog has two friends that are mean and one friend that is not. The frog is watching a movie from 2023. The pelikan does not swear to the frog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the fangtooth does not smile at the frog, then the frog does not acquire a photograph of the bison. Rule2: From observing that one animal acquires a photo of the bison, one can conclude that it also stops the victory of the woodpecker, undoubtedly. Rule3: The frog unquestionably acquires a photo of the bison, in the case where the pelikan does not invest in the company owned by the frog. Rule4: Regarding the frog, if it is watching a movie that was released after covid started, then we can conclude that it refuses to help the swallow. Rule5: The frog will not refuse to help the swallow if it (the frog) is in Turkey at the moment. Rule6: If something refuses to help the swallow and does not capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the walrus, then it will not stop the victory of the woodpecker. Rule7: Regarding the frog, if it has more than 6 friends, then we can conclude that it does not capture the king of the walrus. Rule3 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5. Rule6 is preferred over Rule2.",
