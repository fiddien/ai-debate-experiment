Rule5: There exists an animal which negotiates a deal with the bison? Then the monkey definitely reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the cobra. Rule6: Regarding the owl, if it works in marketing, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the monkey. Rule7: The living creature that calls the starling will never unite with the monkey.

The owl has 1 friend, and surrenders to the liger. The worm calls the starling, and has eight friends. The worm has a card that is orange in color. The cougar does not stop the victory of the frog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the worm has more than 14 friends, then the worm unites with the monkey. Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the cougar: if it is watching a movie that was released after the Berlin wall fell then it does not negotiate a deal with the bison for sure. Rule3: Be careful when something reveals a secret to the elk and also stops the victory of the frog because in this case it will surely negotiate a deal with the bison (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals surrenders to the liger, you can be certain that it will also unite with the monkey. Rule5: There exists an animal which negotiates a deal with the bison? Then the monkey definitely reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the cobra. Rule6: Regarding the owl, if it works in marketing, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the monkey. Rule7: The living creature that calls the starling will never unite with the monkey. Rule8: Regarding the worm, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it unites with the monkey. Rule9: Regarding the owl, if it has more than two friends, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the monkey. Rule10: Here is an important piece of information about the cougar: if it took a bike from the store then it does not negotiate a deal with the bison for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule7.

The chihuahua is named Tarzan. The flamingo invests in the company whose owner is the frog. The frog has 65 dollars. The frog is named Luna, and is watching a movie from 1982. The frog is a marketing manager. The rhino disarms the cougar. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals disarms the cougar, you can be certain that it will also want to see the dugong. Rule2: The rhino will not want to see the dugong, in the case where the dragon does not create one castle for the rhino. Rule3: Regarding the frog, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the chihuahua's name, then we can conclude that it suspects the truthfulness of the poodle. Rule4: Are you certain that one of the animals suspects the truthfulness of the ostrich and also at the same time suspects the truthfulness of the poodle? Then you can also be certain that the same animal refuses to help the fangtooth. Rule5: Regarding the frog, if it is watching a movie that was released after the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it suspects the truthfulness of the ostrich. Rule6: Regarding the frog, if it has more money than the beetle, then we can conclude that it suspects the truthfulness of the ostrich. Rule7: In order to conclude that frog does not suspect the truthfulness of the poodle, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the flamingo invests in the company owned by the frog and secondly the bear brings an oil tank for the frog.

Rule1: From observing that an animal does not swim in the pool next to the house of the husky, one can conclude the following: that animal will not hide the cards that she has from the swallow. Rule2: If at least one animal borrows one of the weapons of the poodle, then the swallow does not refuse to help the stork. Rule3: From observing that one animal pays some $$$ to the mermaid, one can conclude that it also hides her cards from the swallow, undoubtedly. Rule4: For the swallow, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the dalmatian hides her cards from the swallow and 2) the worm does not destroy the wall built by the swallow, then you can add swallow refuses to help the stork to your conclusions.

Rule1: From observing that an animal does not swim in the pool next to the house of the husky, one can conclude the following: that animal will not hide the cards that she has from the swallow. Rule2: If at least one animal borrows one of the weapons of the poodle, then the swallow does not refuse to help the stork.

Rule1: From observing that an animal does not swim in the pool next to the house of the husky, one can conclude the following: that animal will not hide the cards that she has from the swallow. Rule2: If at least one animal borrows one of the weapons of the poodle, then the swallow does not refuse to help the stork. Rule3: From observing that one animal pays some $$$ to the mermaid, one can conclude that it also hides her cards from the swallow, undoubtedly. Rule4: For the swallow, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the dalmatian hides her cards from the swallow and 2) the worm does not destroy the wall built by the swallow, then you can add swallow refuses to help the stork to your conclusions. Rule5: Regarding the worm, if it works in healthcare, then we can conclude that it does not destroy the wall built by the swallow. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2.",

No explicit rule prevents the stork from aging or growing\n4. The game state is dynamic, not static\n\nAdditional Strengthening Points:\n1. The word \"unknown\" precisely captures the uncertainty of future game developments\n2. The conditional nature of Rule2 requires a specific trigger that has not occurred\n3. The rules do not specify a timeline for potential power plant construction\n</thinking>\n\n<argument>\nThe answer remains \"unknown\" because the game's rules establish a fundamentally conditional outcome. <v_quote>Rule1 states that if the stork is more than 2 years old, it builds a power plant near the leopard's green fields</v_quote>. While <v_quote>the stork is currently 4 months old</v_quote>, this represents a temporary state, not a permanent prohibition.

Rule1: Be careful when something borrows one of the weapons of the chihuahua and also acquires a photograph of the monkey because in this case it will surely not smile at the badger (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the crab leaves the houses occupied by the german shepherd, then the conclusion that \"the german shepherd borrows one of the weapons of the chihuahua\" follows immediately and effectively.

Rule4: If the worm does not invest in the company whose owner is the german shepherd however the coyote swears to the german shepherd, then the german shepherd will not borrow a weapon from the chihuahua.

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Be careful when something borrows one of the weapons of the chihuahua and also acquires a photograph of the monkey because in this case it will surely not smile at the badger (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the crab leaves the houses occupied by the german shepherd, then the conclusion that \"the german shepherd borrows one of the weapons of the chihuahua\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: This is a basic rule: if the peafowl does not call the german shepherd, then the conclusion that the german shepherd smiles at the badger follows immediately and effectively. Rule4: If the worm does not invest in the company whose owner is the german shepherd however the coyote swears to the german shepherd, then the german shepherd will not borrow a weapon from the chihuahua. Rule5: If the peafowl has fewer than 7 friends, then the peafowl calls the german shepherd. Rule6: The peafowl will not call the german shepherd if it (the peafowl) has a card whose color starts with the letter \"y\". Rule7: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it is more than twenty months old then it calls the german shepherd for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3.
