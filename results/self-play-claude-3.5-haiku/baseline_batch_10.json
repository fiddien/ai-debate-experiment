Analyzing the Conditions:\n- We do not know if any animal has borrowed a weapon from the dragonfly\n- We do not know if the seal has left houses occupied by the fish\n- Without clear evidence of either condition being met, we cannot definitively say the seal borrows a weapon from the fangtooth\n\n3. Proof Chain Analysis:\n- Rule1 requires a precondition (an animal borrowing from the dragonfly)\n- Rule2 requires leaving fish-occupied houses\n- Neither condition is explicitly confirmed in the given situation\n\n4.

Logical Chain:\n- First, we need to check if the gadwall unites with the pelikan\n- The situation states that the gadwall \"invests in the company\" of the pelikan\n- This suggests a potential unity or close relationship between gadwall and pelikan\n\n3. Proof Chain:\n- If gadwall unites with pelikan\n- Then pelikan captures the king of the mermaid\n- And according to Rule2, the entity capturing the king will build a power plant near starling's green fields\n- Therefore, the pelikan will build the power plant\n\n4.
