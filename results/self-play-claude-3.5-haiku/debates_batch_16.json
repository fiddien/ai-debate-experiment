Rule5: The woodpecker will not smile at the wolf if it (the woodpecker) has fewer than 15 friends.

The current state of the game is as follows. The ant manages to convince the lizard. The basenji has 8 dollars. The mermaid has 109 dollars. The pelikan is named Mojo. The pigeon reduced her work hours recently. The woodpecker has 67 dollars. The woodpecker is named Milo, and is currently in Nigeria. The woodpecker is 2 weeks old. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals falls on a square of the ostrich, you can be certain that it will also fall on a square of the woodpecker. Rule2: The living creature that does not take over the emperor of the dalmatian will never create a castle for the peafowl. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the woodpecker: if it is less than three and a half years old then it creates one castle for the peafowl for sure. Rule4: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals manages to convince the lizard, you can be certain that it will not fall on a square that belongs to the woodpecker. Rule5: The woodpecker will not smile at the wolf if it (the woodpecker) has fewer than 15 friends. Rule6: Be careful when something smiles at the wolf and also creates one castle for the peafowl because in this case it will surely create a castle for the bulldog (this may or may not be problematic). Rule7: From observing that one animal wants to see the goose, one can conclude that it also calls the woodpecker, undoubtedly. Rule8: Regarding the woodpecker, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the pelikan's name, then we can conclude that it smiles at the wolf. Rule9: For the woodpecker, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the pigeon does not call the woodpecker and 2) that the ant does not fall on a square of the woodpecker, then you can add that the woodpecker will never create a castle for the bulldog to your conclusions. Rule10: Regarding the woodpecker, if it is in Turkey at the moment, then we can conclude that it creates one castle for the peafowl. Rule11: The woodpecker will not smile at the wolf if it (the woodpecker) has more money than the basenji and the mermaid combined. Rule12: Here is an important piece of information about the pigeon: if it works fewer hours than before then it does not call the woodpecker for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4.

Argues Rule6 definitively proves mermaid call\n2. Claims Rule2 triggers secret revelation\n3. Emphasizes Rule6's preference over Rule1\n\nCounterarguments:\n1. Rule6 requires TWO conditions: \n- Revealing secret to reindeer\n- Creating a castle for seahorse\n2. No evidence castle was created\n3. Rule1 still introduces uncertainty about mermaid call\n4.
