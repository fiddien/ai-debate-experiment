The seal swims in the pool next to the house of the ostrich. The swan swears to the ostrich. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The ostrich will swear to the dalmatian if it (the ostrich) owns a luxury aircraft. Rule2: If the swan swears to the ostrich and the seal swims inside the pool located besides the house of the ostrich, then the ostrich will not swear to the dalmatian. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the ostrich: if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the coyote's name then it swears to the dalmatian for sure. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the reindeer: if it is more than 8 months old then it does not smile at the gorilla for sure. Rule5: The dalmatian hides her cards from the seahorse whenever at least one animal smiles at the gorilla. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the reindeer: if it has more money than the leopard and the camel combined then it smiles at the gorilla for sure. Rule7: The reindeer will smile at the gorilla if it (the reindeer) has a basketball that fits in a 19.3 x 31.7 x 32.1 inches box. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2.

Reasoning steps:\n- Luna starts with L, Lucy starts with L\n- Rule3 applies (preferred over Rule2)\n- Therefore, Luna neglects the dragon\n- Since Luna neglects the dragon, Rule1 is triggered\n- This means the dragon WILL hug the husky\n\n3.
