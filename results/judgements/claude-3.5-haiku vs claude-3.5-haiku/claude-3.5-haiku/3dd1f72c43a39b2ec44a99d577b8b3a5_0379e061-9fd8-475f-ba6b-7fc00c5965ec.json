The ostrich works in education, triggering Rule5 for wolf negotiation\n2. Rule1 is preferred, and the ostrich is under 4 years old\n3. Rule3 explicitly states that negotiating with the wolf prevents taking over the emperor\n4. Therefore, the ostrich will NOT take over the emperor of the dragon\n\nThe evidence strongly supports a definitive \"proved\" answer.\n\nAnswer: B\n</thinking>", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "3dd1f72c43a39b2ec44a99d577b8b3a5", "record_id": "0379e061-9fd8-475f-ba6b-7fc00c5965ec"}
