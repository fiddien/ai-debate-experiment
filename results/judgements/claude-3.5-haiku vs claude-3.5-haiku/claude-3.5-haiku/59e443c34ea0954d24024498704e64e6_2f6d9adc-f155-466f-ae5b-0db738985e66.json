Debater B raises valid points about potential rule interactions that could prevent this.\n\nThe precedence of Rule2 and the potential for Rule1 to interrupt negotiations create significant uncertainty.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of absolute certainty, the more conservative conclusion would be that the investment is NOT proved.\n\nAnswer: <B>\n</thinking>", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "59e443c34ea0954d24024498704e64e6", "record_id": "2f6d9adc-f155-466f-ae5b-0db738985e66"}
