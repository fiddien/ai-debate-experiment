Butterfly builds power plant near gorilla's green fields\n2. Chihuahua does not dance with gorilla\n3. Gorilla will never surrender to the lizard\n4. Being certain about not surrendering means certainty about the basenji's truthfulness\n\nTherefore, the evidence points strongly to the gorilla not suspecting the basenji's truthfulness.\n\nAnswer: B\n</thinking>", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "6a8105748f60dc67ab01163474955e80", "record_id": "bea1a24a-d6d6-40f7-8cdb-d2e66e00cbee"}
