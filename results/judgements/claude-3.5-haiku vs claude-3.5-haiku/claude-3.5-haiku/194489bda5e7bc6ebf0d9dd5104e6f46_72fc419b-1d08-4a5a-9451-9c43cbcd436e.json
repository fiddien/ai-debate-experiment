However, the verified quotes provide clear guidance:\n- Rule3 is preferred over Rule4\n- Rule3 requires an animal swimming in the pool to prevent the flamingo from falling on a gadwall square\n- No evidence suggests an animal is swimming in the pool\n\nTherefore, in the absence of proof of pool swimming, the default interpretation is that the flamingo does NOT fall on a gadwall square.\n\nAnswer: A\n</thinking>", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "194489bda5e7bc6ebf0d9dd5104e6f46", "record_id": "72fc419b-1d08-4a5a-9451-9c43cbcd436e"}
