Analyzing the debaters' arguments:\n\nDebater A:\n- Uses verified quotes correctly showing Rule1's conditional statement\n- Makes a valid point about ambiguity in determining the camel's persuasive abilities\n- Correctly points out that some conditions are not definitively established\n- References to Rule2 are unverified\n\nDebater B:\n- Uses verified quotes correctly for Rule1 and Rule5\n- References to Rule2 are unverified\n- Makes assumptions about the French Revolution timing that aren't supported by verified quotes\n- Has verified evidence that the swallow smiles at the cougar (Rule5)\n\n2.
