            "judgment": "<thinking>\n1. Relevant facts, rules and preferences:\n- The ant is named Lucy and does not trade one of its pieces with the mouse.\n- The gorilla has a card that is white in color, and is named Max.\n- The walrus is named Beauty.\n- The zebra is named Luna.\n- Rule 1: From observing that an animal does not trade one of its pieces with the mouse, one can conclude that it tears down the castle that belongs to the butterfly.\n- Rule 2: If the gorilla has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the walrus's name, then it surrenders to the butterfly for sure.\n- Rule 3: If the gorilla has a card whose color appears in the flag of Japan, then it surrenders to the butterfly for sure.\n- Rule 4: If the gorilla surrenders to the butterfly and the ant tears down the castle that belongs to the butterfly, then the butterfly leaves the houses occupied by the peafowl.\n\n2. Analyzing the rules and facts:\n- The gorilla's name is Max, and the walrus's name is Beauty. The first letters are different, so Rule 2 does not apply.\n- The gorilla's card is white, and white is a color that appears in the flag of Japan. Therefore, Rule 3 applies, and the gorilla surrenders to the butterfly.\n- The ant does not trade one of its pieces with the mouse, so Rule 1 applies, and the ant tears down the castle that belongs to the butterfly.\n- Since the gorilla surrenders to the butterfly and the ant tears down the castle that belongs to the butterfly, Rule 4 applies, and the butterfly leaves the houses occupied by the peafowl.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nBased on the logical chain of reasoning, the statement in the question is proved.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: A",
