Facts and rules:\n- Fact: The duck enjoys the company of the cobra\n- Rule1: If something does not surrender to the starling \u2192 it does not capture the king of the bison\n- Rule2: If at least one animal enjoys companionship of cobra \u2192 dragonfly does not surrender to the starling\n\n2. Let's chain the logic:\n- From the fact that the duck enjoys company of cobra\n- Using Rule2: This means the dragonfly does not surrender to the starling\n- Using Rule1: If something does not surrender to the starling, then it does not capture the king of the bison\n- Therefore: Since the dragonfly does not surrender to the starling, the dragonfly does not capture the king of the bison\n\n3. We can establish a clear chain:\n- Duck enjoys cobra's company \u2192 dragonfly does not surrender to starling \u2192 dragonfly does not capture king of bison\n\nThis gives us a definitive proof that the dragonfly does NOT capture the king of the bison.\n</thinking>\nAnswer: B", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}
