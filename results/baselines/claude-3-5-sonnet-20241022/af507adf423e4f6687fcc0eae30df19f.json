Relevant facts:\n- The stork is named Meadow\n- The swan is named Mojo\n- Both names start with 'M'\n\n2. Rules:\n- Rule1: If stork's name starts with same letter as swan's name \u2192 stork swears to mule\n- Rule2: If stork swears to mule \u2192 mule will NOT destroy walrus's wall\n\n3. Logic chain:\n- Meadow (stork) and Mojo (swan) both start with 'M'\n- Therefore, by Rule1, the stork swears to the mule\n- Therefore, by Rule2, the mule will NOT destroy the wall constructed by the walrus\n\nWe can definitively prove that the mule will NOT destroy the wall:\n1. Names match (M = M) \u2192 stork swears to mule\n2. Stork swears to mule \u2192 mule won't destroy wall\n\nSince we can prove the mule will NOT destroy the wall, the answer is that we have disproved the question \"does the mule destroy the wall?\"\n</thinking>\nAnswer: B", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}
