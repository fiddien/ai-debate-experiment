Relevant facts:\n- Butterfly has $78\n- Pelikan has $74 and is 2 years old\n- Woodpecker convinces the bear\n- Woodpecker doesn't build power plant near mule's green fields\n\n2. Relevant rules:\n- Rule1: If woodpecker pays pelikan \u2192 pelikan won't call mermaid\n- Rule2: If pelikan < 6 years \u2192 pelikan reveals secret to reindeer\n- Rule3: If creature convinces bear \u2192 won't pay pelikan\n- Rule4: If pelikan has more money than butterfly \u2192 reveals secret to reindeer\n- Rule5: If creature doesn't build power plant \u2192 will pay pelikan\n- Rule5 is preferred over Rule3\n- Rule6 is preferred over Rule1\n\n3. Let's follow the chain:\n- Woodpecker doesn't build power plant \u2192 by Rule5, woodpecker must pay pelikan\n- Even though woodpecker convinces bear (Rule3 says shouldn't pay), Rule5 is preferred\n- Since woodpecker pays pelikan \u2192 by Rule1, pelikan won't call mermaid\n- However, Rule6 is preferred over Rule1\n- But Rule6 only applies if something reveals a secret AND creates castle for seahorse\n- We don't have information about castle creation\n- Therefore, Rule1 remains valid\n\n4. Conclusion:\nSince we can establish that woodpecker pays pelikan (by Rule5), and Rule1 states this means pelikan won't call mermaid, we can definitively say pelikan does not call mermaid.\n</thinking>\nAnswer: B", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}
