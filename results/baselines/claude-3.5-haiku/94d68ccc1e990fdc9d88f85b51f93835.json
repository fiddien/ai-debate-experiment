Relevant Facts and Rules:\n- The stork is currently 4 months old\n- Rule1: If stork is more than 2 years old, it builds a power plant near leopard's green fields\n- Rule2: If power plant is built near leopard's green fields, leopard will hug the german shepherd\n\n2. Logical Chain Analysis:\n- First, check if the stork meets the condition for building a power plant\n- 4 months old is NOT more than 2 years old\n- Therefore, the stork does NOT build a power plant\n- Since no power plant is built, the condition for the leopard hugging the german shepherd is NOT triggered\n\n3. Proof Chain:\n- Condition for power plant: Not met (stork too young)\n- Condition for hugging: Depends on power plant being built\n- Therefore, the leopard does NOT hug the german shepherd\n\nThe key point is that the initial condition (stork being over 2 years old) is not satisfied, so the subsequent actions do not occur.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: B", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "94d68ccc1e990fdc9d88f85b51f93835"}
