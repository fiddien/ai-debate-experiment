Relevant Facts:\n- The worm has 8 friends\n- The worm has an orange card\n- The owl has 1 friend\n- The owl surrenders to the liger\n- The cougar parked her bike in front of the store\n\n2. Analyzing Rule5: \"If an animal negotiates a deal with the bison, then the monkey reveals something to the cobra\"\n\n3. Checking conditions for negotiating with the bison:\n- Rule3 (preferred over Rule10 and Rule2) suggests negotiation if something reveals a secret to the elk and stops the frog's victory\n- Rule10 suggests no negotiation if the cougar took a bike from the store\n- Rule2 suggests no negotiation if watching a post-Berlin wall movie\n\n4. Checking monkey's conditions:\n- Rule1: Monkey unites if worm has >14 friends (not true, worm has 8)\n- Rule8: Monkey unites if worm has a primary color card (orange is not primary)\n- Rule7: Worm calling starling prevents monkey uniting (but Rule1 is preferred)\n\n5. Conclusion: No clear proof that an animal negotiates with the bison\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say whether the monkey reveals a secret to the cobra.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: C", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "c4a98ac0e14a12d2a5e9b2dc665690fc"}
