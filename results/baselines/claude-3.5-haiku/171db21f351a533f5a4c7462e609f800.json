Relevant Facts and Rules:\n- The gadwall invests in the company of the pelikan\n- Rule1: If gadwall unites with pelikan, then pelikan captures the king of the mermaid\n- Rule2: The living creature that captures the king of the mermaid will build a power plant near the green fields of the starling\n\n2. Logical Chain:\n- First, we need to check if the gadwall unites with the pelikan\n- The situation states that the gadwall \"invests in the company\" of the pelikan\n- This suggests a potential unity or close relationship between gadwall and pelikan\n\n3. Proof Chain:\n- If gadwall unites with pelikan\n- Then pelikan captures the king of the mermaid\n- And according to Rule2, the entity capturing the king will build a power plant near starling's green fields\n- Therefore, the pelikan will build the power plant\n\n4. Conclusion:\n- The logical chain supports that the pelikan will indeed build a power plant near the starling's green fields\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: A", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "171db21f351a533f5a4c7462e609f800"}
