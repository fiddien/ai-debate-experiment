Relevant Facts:\n- The basenji is named Luna\n- The mermaid is named Lucy\n- The mermaid has 4 friends that are easy going and 2 friends that are not\n- The mermaid has a 14 x 15 inches notebook\n\n2. Rules:\n- Rule1: If the mermaid does not destroy the otter's wall, the otter will shout at the seal\n- Rule2: If the mermaid's name starts with the same letter as the basenji's name, the mermaid does not destroy the wall\n- Rule3: If the mermaid has fewer than 4 friends, the mermaid does not destroy the wall\n\n3. Analysis:\n- Lucy (mermaid) and Luna (basenji) both start with L, so Rule2 applies\n- The mermaid has 6 total friends (4 easy going + 2 not), which is more than 4\n- Rule2 prevents the mermaid from destroying the wall\n- Therefore, by Rule1, the otter WILL shout at the seal\n\n4.
