No, because Rule4 says the dragon does not neglect the bee when an oil tank is brought for the dugong (which happened).\n   - Does the dragon invest in the mermaid's company? No, because:\n     a) Rule2 says if the dragon watches a post-Nixon movie, it doesn't invest\n     b) The dragon is watching a 1960 movie (which is before Nixon's resignation)\n4.
