To prove the monkey shouts at the crow, I need to trace the logical chain in Rule4\n2. Rule4 states: If an animal wants to see the dinosaur but does not swear to the dragon, then it shouts at the crow\n3. Let's check if the monkey wants to see the dinosaur:\n   - Rule10 says monkey wants to see dinosaur if it has more money than chihuahua and starling combined\n   - Monkey has 90 dollars, chihuahua has 16, starling has 95\n   - 90 is NOT more than 16 + 95, so initially monkey does NOT want to see dinosaur\n4. But Rule3 says if monkey's name starts with same letter as elk's name, it wants to see dinosaur\n   - Monkey is named Max\n   - Elk is named Mojo\n   - Both names start with M, so monkey DOES want to see dinosaur\n5. Rule7 says if monkey published high-quality paper, it does not swear to the dragon\n   - Monkey recently read a high-quality paper\n6.
