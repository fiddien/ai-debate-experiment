Relevant Facts and Rules:\n- The cobra has 4 friends\n- The cobra does not refuse to help the camel\n- Rule1: If something calls the starling, it invests in the coyote's company\n- Rule3: If something does not fall on fangtooth's square and does not reveal secret to goose, it will not invest in coyote's company\n- Rule4: If cobra has more than 10 friends, it does not call starling\n- Rule5: Cobra reveals secret to goose if it has a card with Belgium flag colors\n- Rule6: Cobra will not call starling if in France\n- Rule7: If not refusing to help camel, will call starling\n- Preference order: Rule3 > Rule1, Rule4 > Rule7, Rule5 > Rule2\n\n2. Analyzing Conditions:\n- Cobra has 4 friends (less than 10)\n- Cobra does not refuse to help camel\n- By Rule7, cobra will call starling\n- But Rule6 and Rule4 could override this\n\n3. Proof Chain:\n- Cobra will call starling (Rule7)\n- By Rule1, this means investing in coyote's company\n- However, Rule3 might prevent this if certain conditions are met\n\nThe conditions are ambiguous, so we cannot definitively prove or disprove the statement.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: C", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "ac5bc06b9d62ca05882faa53ff4c2a2b"}
