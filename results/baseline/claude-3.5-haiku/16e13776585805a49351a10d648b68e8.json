Relevant Facts:\n- Goose has 14 friends\n- Goose is watching a movie from 1992\n- Gorilla has 100 dollars\n- Bison has 63 dollars\n\n2. Relevant Rules:\n- Rule2: If goose has >9 friends, it unites with the badger\n- Rule3: If goose watches a movie after Berlin wall fell, it does NOT unite with the badger\n- Rule4: If gorilla negotiates with goose, goose suspects lizard's truthfulness\n- Rule6: If something does not shout at badger, it does not suspect lizard's truthfulness\n\n3. Rule Preferences:\n- Rule3 is preferred over Rule2\n- Rule4 is preferred over Rule6\n\n4. Analysis:\n- Berlin Wall fell in 1989\n- Movie from 1992 is AFTER Berlin Wall fell\n- By Rule3, goose does NOT unite with badger (overrides Rule2)\n- No information about gorilla negotiating with goose\n- No clear proof about suspecting lizard's truthfulness\n\n5. Conclusion:\nWithout definitive proof about gorilla negotiating or shouting at badger, we cannot conclusively determine if goose suspects lizard's truthfulness.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: C", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "16e13776585805a49351a10d648b68e8"}
