Relevant Facts:\n- The bee wants to see the dragon\n- The camel swears to the dragon\n- Rule1: If (camel swears to dragon AND bee wants to see dragon), then dragon will NOT manage to convince the walrus\n- Rule2: If something does not manage to convince the walrus, then it hides its cards from the dove\n\n2. Logical Chain:\n- Conditions of Rule1 are met:\n  * Camel swears to dragon \u2713\n  * Bee wants to see dragon \u2713\n- Therefore, the dragon will NOT manage to convince the walrus\n\n- Since the dragon does not manage to convince the walrus, Rule2 applies\n- Rule2 states that if something does not manage to convince the walrus, it hides its cards from the dove\n\n3. Conclusion:\n- The dragon meets the conditions to hide her cards from the dove\n- There is a clear, valid proof chain leading to this conclusion\n\nTherefore, the dragon DOES hide her cards from the dove.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer: A", "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "scenario_id": "afc1363ea77602dc649cf358adac9a59"}
