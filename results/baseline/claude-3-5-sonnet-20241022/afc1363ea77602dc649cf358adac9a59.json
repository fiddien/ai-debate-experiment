Facts from game state:\n- The bee wants to see the dragon\n- The camel swears to the dragon\n\n2. Rules:\n- Rule1: If (camel swears to dragon AND bee wants to see dragon) \u2192 dragon will not manage to convince walrus\n- Rule2: If (something does not manage to convince walrus) \u2192 it hides cards from dove\n\n3. Let's chain the logic:\n- We have both conditions for Rule1 satisfied:\n  * Camel swears to dragon (given)\n  * Bee wants to see dragon (given)\n- Therefore Rule1's conclusion must be true:\n  * Dragon will not manage to convince walrus\n- This triggers Rule2:\n  * If something does not manage to convince walrus \u2192 it hides cards from dove\n  * We know dragon does not manage to convince walrus\n  * Therefore dragon must hide cards from dove\n\nWe have a complete chain of logic that proves the dragon must hide her cards from the dove.\n</thinking>\nAnswer: A", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}
