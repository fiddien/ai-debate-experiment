Relevant facts:\n- Gorilla has 100 dollars\n- Bison has 63 dollars\n- Gorilla has an indigo card\n- Goose has 14 friends\n- Goose is watching a movie from 1992\n- Berlin wall fell in 1989\n\n2. Relevant rules:\n- Rule4: If gorilla negotiates with goose \u2192 goose suspects lizard\n- Rule6: If something doesn't shout at badger \u2192 it doesn't suspect lizard\n- Rule4 is preferred over Rule6\n\n3. Analysis:\n- To determine if goose suspects lizard, we need to establish if either Rule4 or Rule6 applies\n- We don't have any direct information about whether the gorilla negotiates with the goose\n- We don't have any information about shouting at the badger\n- Without this key information, we cannot establish either condition\n- Even though Rule4 is preferred over Rule6, we don't have enough information to trigger either rule\n\n4. Looking for indirect connections:\n- Other rules mainly deal with stopping victory and uniting with badger\n- None of these rules help establish whether gorilla negotiates with goose or about shouting at badger\n\n5. Conclusion:\n- We don't have enough information to determine whether the goose suspects the truthfulness of the lizard\n- We can't prove it's true or false\n</thinking>\nAnswer: C", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}
